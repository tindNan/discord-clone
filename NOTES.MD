# Lesson 1

I decided to use vue instead of the react. Reason being I just want to build more stuff using vue

I used vite, vue 3 + tailwind (check the internet for how to configure these)

I learnt that the utility classes are simple shorthands for stuff that you already know in css.

I ended up building a posts component for the items. I didn't get round to fully splitting out a component.
This will be left as a todo

## TODO
- [ ] extract posts into their own component
